        <h1> Exercises to Lose Weight</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Aside from dieting, exercising is one of the most common strategies employed by those trying to shed extra pounds. 
                
                    <br>
                    <br>
                Here are the 8 best exercises for weight loss.</h2>
                <br>

                
                        <h2 style="position: absolute;"> 1 - Walking</h2>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                       
                                <p> It’s convenient and an easy way for beginners to start exercising without feeling overwhelmed or needing to purchase equipment. Also, it’s a lower-impact exercise, meaning it doesn’t stress your joints.
            According to Harvard Health, it’s estimated that a 155-pound (70-kg) person burns around 167 calories per 30 minutes of walking at a moderate pace of 4 mph (6.4 km/h)
            <br>
            It’s easy to fit walking into your daily routine. To add more steps to your day, try walking during your lunch break, taking the stairs at work, or taking your dog for extra walks.
            <br>
            To get started, aim to walk for 30 minutes 3–4 times a week. You can gradually increase the duration or frequency of your walks as you become more fit.
            
            </p>

                <h2 style="position: absolute;"> 2 - Jogging or running</h2>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                
                    <p> Both jogging and running are great exercises that can be done anywhere and are easy to incorporate into your weekly routine.
                         To get started, aim to jog for 20–30 minutes 3–4 times per week.
            
                            If you find jogging or running outdoors to be hard on your joints, try running on softer surfaces like grass. 
                            Also, many treadmills have built-in cushioning, which may be easier on your joints. <br>
                        Jogging and running are great exercises for weight loss that are easy to incorporate into your weekly routine. 
                        They can also help burn belly fat, which is linked to many chronic diseases.

                <h2 style="position: absolute;"> 3 - Cycling</h2>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>

        <p> Although cycling is traditionally done outdoors, many gyms and fitness centers have stationary bikes that allow you to cycle while staying indoors.

            Harvard Health estimates that a 155-pound (70-kg) person burns around 260 calories per 30 minutes of cycling on a stationary bike at a moderate pace, or 298 calories per 30 minutes on a bicycle at a moderate pace of 12–13.9 mph (19–22.4 km/h) 
            <br>
        Cycling is great for people of all fitness levels and can be done outdoors on a bicycle or indoors on a stationary bike. 
        It has been linked to various health benefits, including increased insulin sensitivity and a reduced risk of certain chronic diseases.

        <br>

        <p> Weight training is a popular choice for people looking to lose weight.

        According to Harvard Health, it’s estimated that a 155-pound (70-kg) person burns roughly 112 calories per 30 minutes of weight training.
            <br>
        Also, weight training can help you build strength and promote muscle growth, which can raise your resting metabolic rate (RMR), or how many calories your body burns at rest
        Weight training can help you lose weight by burning calories during and after your workout. 
        It may also help you build muscle mass, which raises your resting metabolic rate — the number of calories your body burns at rest.

            <h2 style="position: absolute;"> 5 - High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p> Typically, a HIIT workout lasts 10–30 minutes and can burn a lot of calories.

                One study in 9 active men found that HIIT burned 25–30% more calories per minute than other types of exercises, including weight training, cycling, and running on a treadmill.
                
                That means HIIT can help you burn more calories while spending less time exercising.
                <br>
                Interval training is an effective weight loss strategy that can be applied to many types of exercises, including running, jumping, biking, and more. Incorporating interval training into your routine can help you burn more calories in less time.

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> Swimming is a fun way to lose weight and get in shape.

                Harvard Health estimates that a 155-pound (70-kg) person burns approximately 233 calories per half hour of swimming.
                
                How you swim appears to affect how many calories you burn. Per 30 minutes, a 155-pound (70-kg) person burns 298 calories doing backstroke, 
                372 calories doing breaststroke, 409 calories doing butterfly, and 372 calories treading water.
                <br>
                Swimming is a great low-impact exercise for people looking to lose weight. 
                Moreover, it may help improve your flexibility and reduce risk factors for various diseases.

        <p> Yoga is a popular way to exercise and relieve stress.

                While it’s not commonly thought of as a weight loss exercise, it burns a fair amount of calories and offers many additional health benefits that can promote weight loss.
                
                Harvard Health estimates that a 155-pound (70-kg) person burns around 149 calories per 30 minutes of practicing yoga.
                <br>
                Yoga is a great weight loss exercise that can be done nearly anywhere. It not only burns calories but also teaches you mindfulness to help you resist food cravings.

        <br>

        <p> Pilates is a great beginner-friendly exercise that may help you lose weight.

                According to a study sponsored by the American Council on Exercise, a person weighing around 140 pounds (64 kg) would burn 108 calories at a 30-minute beginner’s Pilates class, or 168 calories at an advanced class of the same duration.
                
                Although Pilates may not burn as many calories as aerobic exercises like running, many people find it enjoyable, which makes it easier to stick to over time.
        <br>
        Pilates is a great beginner-friendly exercise that can help you lose weight while improving other areas of your physical fitness, such as strength, balance, flexibility, and endurance.
